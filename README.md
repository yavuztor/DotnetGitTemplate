# DotnetGitTemplate

dotnet template is a great tool to improve developer experience. However, it requires either using a local folder or using a nuget feed to distribute the templates. 

This tool allows you to use git repositories by wrapping up a few tasks that you would need to do otherwise. It is really created to improve the workflow and practice creating a dotnet tool.

__Note: You will need dotnet and git installed and available in your path.__
